# Context

This project is the continuation of the scraping project.  
In this previous project, we scrap the immoweb.be website.  
You can find the detail of this previous project [here](https://github.com/Ezamey/challenge-collecting-data).  

## Description

In this project we clean, analyse and interpret the data from the immoweb website.  
You can find the pdf with some explanation of the result, but you can have more visualization if you run the files by yourself.  

## Usage

The files to run is the `interpretation.ipynb  
In this file, the dataset is cleaned, you can see the correlation matrix and the visualization for the best and worst region, province and cities.  

## Python Libraries

We use pandas for cleaning the data, and seaborn to display these data.
